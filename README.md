**CPSC 362 - Foundations of software engineering project: Package tracker/ Billing program**
-
**Project brainstorm idea:**

This software will focus on a variety of aspects that are used to calculate the tracking and purchase information of a parcel/package being sent from one destination to another. This will be executed and done on the computer's terminal as its front end of information display output and input, but include a terminal based hud for navigation, similar to front-end UI’s development aspects

The program will include aspects such as…

Destination package time calculation based off inputted location of the package and the delivery
Package weight, amount, and fee calculation of taxes, and other delivery charges, depending on the package weight and sending weight limits
Package and purchase history log for user data and other data editing elements of user information  
Terminal UI utilizing ascii art and other terminal-based UI applications to guide the user's experience with the program in a simple and understandable way
And more implementation ideas in the future.. 

These aspects are not permanent, and some may be removed or added if needed to be restructured in accordance with the project's guideline requirements.
